Support files for _[Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](http://socviz.co)_ and courses taught from it. This repo is an RStudio project and contains a series of RMarkdown files organized in parallel to the book's chapters. The code for almost all the figures is provided, along with space for your own notes. A more general note-taking template is in the `template/` folder.

With R and RStudio installed, students can use this repo via the `usethis` package. From the R console, 

`> install.packages("usethis", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")`

Then:

`library(usethis)`

`use_course("https://github.com/kjhealy/dataviz/archive/master.zip")`

or

`use_course("goo.gl/jiPYYk")`

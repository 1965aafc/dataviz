Support files for _[Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](http://socviz.co)_ and courses taught from it. This repo is an RStudio project and contains a series of RMarkdown files organized in parallel to the book's chapters. The code for almost all the figures is provided, along with space for your own notes. A more general note-taking template is in the `template/` folder.
